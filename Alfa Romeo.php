    <h1>Alfa Romeo</h1>
    <p>The below quote summarizes the impact and the profound work that this Italian automaker has given to the world. Creating history for over 100 years, Alfa Romeo started their humble beginnings as a French company in Italy (that’s a weird combination), and worked on cementing their legacy by building a storied racing heritage, supporting it with countless wins, discovering a young racer named Enzo Ferrari, and being known as a ‘petrolhead’ marque.</p>
    <p>Alfa Romeo has accomplished many wins such as “The World's Best Motor Race”, the Mille Miglia in 1928, Le Mans, various Grand Prix, World Sportscar Championship, German Touring Car Championship, just to name a few.</p>
    <p>That quote also exemplifies the craftsmanship that went to every single Alfa Romeo, painstakingly creating works of art like the P2 in 1924, the original Giulia in 1962, or the GTA in 1965.</p>
    <p>Being flamboyant as any Italian can be, the company poured their heart and soul in every creation, focusing on aesthetics and making sure that their everyday, practical models (the 155, 156, the Bretta) were jaw-dropping to make their ancestors proud.</p>
    <p>Alfa Romeos are known for their quirks and questionable reliability, but we don’t care. They’re graceful, elegant, and oh so undeniably pretty. Alongside their beauty, we embrace these cars because it’s the closest car that gives us an almost-human connection.</p>

    <p class="text-white">Giuseppe Merosi designed Alfa Romeo's official emblem. Apart from some minor tweaks with the wording, gold trim, and wreath appearance over the years, the design has remained fairly consistent. The left side of the emblem is a red cross over a white background– a medieval Christian symbol. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA</h2>
    <p>As reported on EVO, there are many juicy details to dig into, so without further ado, some facts and numbers.Same Ferrari-built 2.9 liter, twin turbo, 90 degree V6 from the Quadrifoglio, has been back to the Ferrari Advanced Engineering Lab, now with power bumped to 532 HP.</p>
    <p>In the GTA, over 100 KG saved over the standard Quadrifoglio, bringing total vehicle weight to 1520 KG (3,351 lbs)</p>
    <p>In the GTAm, weight savings have gone to the extreme with the removal of the back row of seats and the fitment of a half body roll cage.</p>
   
</div>
</div>
     <div class="container-fluid">
    <p>Much of these weight savings were gained via extensive use of carbon fiber. The hood, roof, trunk lid, front spoiler, trunk spoiler (GTA), rear spoiler (GTAm), and diffuser are all made of 100% bespoke carbon fiber pieces. The GTAm also gets a cheeky little tow hook sticking out of the front, an homage to the original GTA race cars of the 50’s and 60’s.</p>
    <p>Internally, the seats are carbon fiber buckets up front with full 4 point Sabelt harnesses, and the steering wheel is now mostly leather covered carbon fiber.</p>
    <p>The entirety of the center stack and dash are also made of carbon fiber, and covered where needed in alcantara.</p>
    <p>The entire car has been dropped by about a quarter of an inch, and new bespoke springs, dampers, and suspension setup give the car a much more aggressive driving dynamic.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">2008 Alfa Romeo 8C Spider</h2>
    <p>19/02/2008 – Alfa Romeo once again unveils its new models onto the world market at the Geneva event. Indeed, following on from the Alfa 159 and Brera in 2005, the 159 Sportwagon and Spider in 2006, and its Personalisation Programme going by the name of “Alfa Unica” in 2007, it is now the turn of the alluring Alfa 8C Spider. Like the Alfa 8C Competizione, the Gran Turismo which received resounding global praise; the new “discovery” will be produced in a limited edition run of 500.</p>

Cars such as the Giulietta Spider from the 50’s or the legendary Duetto made famous by “The Graduate” from 1967 with a young Dustin Hoffman. Today, it’s the Alfa 8C Spider’s turn to take centre stage and project into the future the values of technology and emotion which belong to the Alfa Romeo legacy.</p>
    
</div>
<div class="container-fluid m-2">
<p>Obviously, the new vehicle inherits all the winning features of the Coupè version. Starting with the two “sport seats” setup and the fascinating exterior lines, which characterized by sculpted and finely designed bodywork, “dress” the automotive and mechanical excellence of the model.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider</h2>
<p>Adding to the Alfa Romeo brand’s legendary racing history and the exciting experience of open-air motoring, the all-new 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider debuts with panoramic views complemented with a signature Alfa exhaust note, plus the essential sportiness of the award-winning 4C Coupe: handcrafted in Modena, Italy; groundbreaking and seductive Italian style; state-of-the-art Formula 1 inspired carbon fiber monocoque chassis that enables an incredible power-to-weight ratio; advanced technologies, including the all-aluminum 1750 cc turbocharged engine with direct-injection, intercoolers, and variable-valve timing that enable supercar-level performance.</p>
<p>The Alfa Romeo 4C Spider name recalls the brand’s great sporting tradition: the acronyms 8C and 6C in the 1930s and 1940s distinguished racing and road cars fitted with powerful eight- and six-cylinder engines. Like the award-winning 4C Coupe, the all-new 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider model’s designation is a return to “the great Alfa Romeos” and continues this tradition with the innovative all-aluminum 1750 cc turbocharged direct injection, intercooler four-cylinder engine, delivering an impressive 136 horsepower per liter.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid m-2">
    <p>With seating for two, panoramic views and the soundtrack of an Italian performance-tuned engine and exhaust, Spiders are among the most exhilarating experiences in motoring – and represent the very core of Alfa Romeo’s DNA and heritage.</p>
    <p>The 4C Spider draws from a bloodline that includes some of the most purpose-built performance models that illustrate lightness and efficiency with undeniable Alfa Romeo style: the aluminum-bodied 8C 2900 B Touring (1938); the 1900 C52 “Flying Saucer” (1952), which could exceed 140 mph (230 kph); and most notably the legendary 33 Stradale (1967) with its mid-engine and magnesium alloy and steel tube chassis “clothed” by groundbreaking styling, which is functional and distinctly Italian. And now it is the 4C Spider’s turn to deliver the driving thrill, performance and unforgettable emotion that only an Alfa Romeo Spider provokes.</p>
