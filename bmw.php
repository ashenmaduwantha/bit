    <h1>BMW</h1>
    <P>Not everybody knows that BMW started as a manufacturer of aircraft engines. In October 1913 Karl Friedrich Rapp establishes "Rapp-Motorenwerke" in a former bicycle factory near Munich.</P>
    <P>Rapp was an engineer who arise through the Daimler system and "Rapp-Motorenwerke" was set up as a subsidiary of "Flugwerk", an airplane maker. He starts manufacturing his own aircraft engines but unfortunately they suffered from problems with vibrations.</P>
    <P>In 1917, BMW's first aircraft engine, the Type IIIa, goes into production. It is a water-cooled six-cylinder inline engine, it features a unique "high-altitude carburetor" developed by chief engineer Max Friz that allows it to develop full power at altitude. Max Friz was a grand engineering mind who would dominate BMW's product development culture on into the 1960's.</P>
    <P>BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1929 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.</P>
    <P>BMW's team of engineers progressively developed their cars from small Seven-based cars into six-cylinder luxury cars and, in 1936, began production of the BMW 328 sports car. Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II.</P>
    <P>During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1930, BMW attempted to introduce a new front axle with independent wheel suspension for both their models, the BMW 'Dixi' 3/15 DA4 and BMW 'Wartburg' DA3, but this resulted in accidents with the prototypes because of construction faults.</P>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">BMW i8</h2>
<p>With all the new technologies that seem to be bursting through the pipeline these days, it has become hard to remember the time when the BMW i8 was first unveiled to the public. Released  during what feels like the olden days now, the 2014 BMW i8 revolutionized the automotive landscape by pioneering what is recognized to be the first high-performance hybrid sports car.</p>
<p>Well ahead of its time, its powertrain technology was the result of BMW’s visionary approach to a rapidly shifting narrative towards a future focused on sustainability. The eventual overthrowing of the combustion engine would be at the forefront of this movement, with EVs taking their place. The BMW i8 would be the earliest creation in this image.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="conatiner-fluid pt-2">
<p>The BMW i8 provides more of a transitional approach to this, than a radical one – being a plug-in hybrid as opposed to fully-electric – but would nevertheless be disrupting the status quo.  Since its 2014 release, we are still currently in the same production run based on the initial platform. </p>
<p>While the original car was relatively trailblazing for its time, BMW hasn’t made a whole lot of changes to the i8 since its 2014 release. There have been few noteworthy upgrades, if any, unless the optional Laserlight headlamps introduced in 2016 are your thing. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">2020 BMW M8</h2>
<p>We just recently discussed the verdict of the M8 Competition Coupe. The car gets high marks from the folks who were on the press drive, and now BMW has some more M8 news. The company just revealed the M8 Gran Coupe. This is the four-door coupe-like cousin of the regular BMW M8 Coupe.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the car. The M8 Gran Coupe and the M8 Competition Gran Coupe. For the most part, the cars are the same as their regular coupe counterparts. However, the car does have two more doors and an extra 200mm (almost 8 inches) of wheelbase. </p>
<p>BMW has not released the curb weight of this car, but it has to be more than the two-door model. There’s simply more of the car here. The weight was already a concern for some testers who drove it, so it may be notable. BMW has made efforts to keep weight down by utilizing carbon fiber, so the weight might not be all that much more than the two-door variant. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid m-2">
    <p>In terms of performance, you can rest assured they’re both just as capable as their two-door counterparts. For example, the M8 Competition Gran Coupe is just as capable as the regular two-door model. It’ll make 0-62 mph in just 3.2 seconds and has a top speed of 155 mph. The same 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that’s in the coupe is in the gran coupe, so it’s not much of a surprise performance is still strong. </p>
